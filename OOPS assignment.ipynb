What is method overloading in Python?\n","  * In Python, method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (either in terms of number or types of arguments). However, Python does not support traditional method overloading (like in languages such as Java or C++) where we can explicitly define multiple methods with the same name but different argument signatures. Instead, Python uses default arguments or variable-length argument lists to simulate method overloading. You can have a single method definition that can handle different types or numbers of arguments."],"metadata":{"id":"W1M3DrnB9BEA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","  * Method overriding is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.

What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  * In Python, the property decorator is used to define a method as a getter for an attribute.

Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","  * Polymorphism is one of the core principles of OOP and plays a crucial role in creating flexible, maintainable, and reusable code. In simple terms, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, even if they behave differently. This concept is often summarized as \"many shapes\"—i.e., the ability for different classes to share a common interface but implement their own version of the method."],"metadata":{"id":"KVSEypMU8yI3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  * In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. It allows you to define a common interface for a group of related classes and provides the structure that subclasses must follow. Abstract classes can define both abstract methods (which have no implementation) and concrete methods (which have an implementation)."],"metadata":{"id":"U27ECxKk9Hsj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","  * 1. Encapsulation: OOP allows you to break down a problem into smaller, manageable chunks called objects. Each object is a self-contained unit that represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).\n","    2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class (the subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the superclass). This helps reduce redundancy and makes code more maintainable.\n","    3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name, but with different implementations. It also allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n","    4.

What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","  * Multiple inheritance in Python refers to a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class, allowing it to inherit the attributes and methods from multiple classes.

A child class can inherit from multiple parent classes."],"metadata":{"id":"RiqJPsNq-qMh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n","    1. __str__ Method:\n","The __str__ method is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object.

The goal of __repr__ is to provide a detailed and unambiguous string that could, in theory, be used to recreate the object.

What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","  * The super() function in Python is a powerful built-in function used primarily in inheritance scenarios.

What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","   * The __del__ method in Python is a special method that acts as a destructor for an object. It is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it is no longer in use and is being garbage collected.The __del__ method allows you to define custom cleanup behavior when an object is being destroyed. This might involve releasing resources like file handles, network connections, or database connections, and generally cleaning up any other resources that the object might have allocated during its lifetime.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xaTTptSl_ydh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n"," 1. @staticmethod:\n","Definition: A @staticmethod is a method that does not take self or cls as the first parameter. It behaves like a regular function that belongs to the class’s namespace, but it doesn't have access to the instance (self) or the class (cls).\n","\n","Access: A static method can't access or modify the class state or instance state. It is usually used when you want to perform some operation that is related to the class but doesn't need to access any instance or class-specific data.\n","\n","Use Case: Typically used for utility functions that perform actions but don't need access to any instance or class data.\n","\n","2. @classmethod:\n","Definition: A @classmethod is a method that takes cls as the first parameter, which refers to the class itself, not an instance of the class. This allows the method to access and modify class-level attributes and state.\n","\n","Access: A class method can modify the class state that applies to all instances of the class. It is often used for factory methods or other methods that need to operate at the class level rather than the instance level.\n","\n","Use Case: Typically used when the method needs to work with the class itself rather than instances, such as in alternative constructors or methods that affect the class as a whole."],"metadata":{"id":"wsGxs1WWAHcB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  * In Python, polymorphism is typically implemented in the following way:\n","\n","A base class defines a method.\n","\n","A derived class overrides that method.\n","\n","The method behaves differently based on the object calling it, which allows the same interface (method name) to be used for objects of different classes."],"metadata":{"id":"VLrRFS_JAYZz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","   * Method chaining in Python (or any object-oriented programming language) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line. This is possible when each method in the chain returns the object itself (or a modified version of it), so that the next method can be called on that object directly.\n","\n","In Python, method chaining is often used to write clean, concise, and readable code, especially when you need to perform a series of actions on an object in a fluid, linear manner."],"metadata":{"id":"HCGFZCfdAkun"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  * The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.
